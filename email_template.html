    <p>Hey <%= firstName%>,</p>
    <br>
    <p>
      How are you doing? I'm doing well. It's been almost <%= numMonthsSinceContact%> months
      since we last talked. I'm learning to code full-time at Fullstack Academy and enjoying
      my time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've been blogging about my experiences at Fullstack on my blog.
      Here are some updates from the last 7 days:
      <ul>
      <% for(var i=0; i<latestPosts.length; i++) {%>
         <li><a href=<%= latestPosts[i].post_url %> </a> <%= latestPosts[i].title %> </li>
      <% } %>
      </ul>

    </p>
    <p>
      Talk soon,<br>
      Sam
